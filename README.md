# Delivery
COS 333 Project. TigerMeals Delivery will provide a platform for members of the Princeton community to order food catering. More specifically, it will be an app that provides information on restaurant availability, catering packages and rates, and delivery features for restaurants in the local area. Interfaces for Princeton members placing orders and restaurants satisfying orders will reduce the complexity of the process and create a consistent environment for local restaurants to engage with the Princeton community. Princeton members may place orders via two different types of interfaces, with the phone-compatible mobile version of the application, as well as the web version they can access online.
